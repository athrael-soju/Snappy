              Document ingestion pushes files to the backend, triggers indexing, and streams progress through
              server-sent events. Search and chat features query the same vector store so you can jump between keyword
              retrieval and conversational answers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Configuration and maintenance pages call the same APIs as their earlier counterparts but present the
              controls as streamlined forms. When something goes wrong you can reset storage, re-run initialization, or
              tweak environment settings without leaving the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Explore the repository to see how each feature is wired. Backend endpoints are generated from OpenAPI
              definitions, and shared stores keep state in a single context. Extend the UI as neededâ€”this version
              provides a clean baseline for custom styling.
