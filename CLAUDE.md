# General
- Implement changes robustly; no backward-compatibility shims or fallbacks unless explicitly requested
- Clean up obsolete files when done; update existing docs but don't create new ones unless asked
- If a problem-solving approach isn't working, try a different angle

# Backend
- For route-specific changes, rerun the OpenAPI script via `scripts/generate_openapi.py`

# Frontend
- If the backend OpenAPI script has run, also run `yarn gen:sdk` and use the updated autogenerated files
- Do not modify anything under `frontend/components/ui`

# Releases
Use conventional commit format:
- `feat` for new features
- `fix` for bug fixes
- `chore` for maintenance tasks
- `docs` for documentation
- `refactor` for code refactoring
