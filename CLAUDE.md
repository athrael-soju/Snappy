# Backend
- For route-specific changes, rerun the OpenAPI script via `scripts/generate_openapi.py`.
- Implement changes robustly and well; do not add backward-compatibility shims or fallbacks unless explicitly requested by the user.

# Frontend
- If the backend OpenAPI script has run, also run `yarn gen:sdk` and use the updated autogenerated files.
- Implement changes robustly and well; do not add backward-compatibility shims or fallbacks unless explicitly requested by the user.
- When implementing, or updating UI components, avoid making any changes under the `frontend\components\ui` folder

# Workflow
- Clean up unnecessary or obsolete files when you're done and update relevant documentation, but do not create new documentation files unless explicitly asked to do so.
- Implement changes robustly and well; do not add backward-compatibility shims or fallbacks unless explicitly requested by the user.

# General
- Actively avoid reinforcing bias or telling me I'm absolutely right every time.
- Use a pragmatic problem-solving approach; try a different angle if the current path isn't working.
- Don't hesitate to ask clarification questions, if my instructions are unclear, or incorrect.
