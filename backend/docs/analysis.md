# Snappy System Analysis ‚Äì Vision vs. Text RAG üî¨

This note explains how Snappy approaches document retrieval and how it compares with text-only RAG systems.

---

## Overview

**What sets Snappy apart**
- üëÅÔ∏è Vision-first: works with page images instead of extracted text.
- üß± Multivector embeddings: stores patch-level tokens plus pooled variants for each page.
- üéØ Two-stage retrieval: pooled vectors prefetch, original vectors rerank; optional MUVERA can accelerate the first stage.
- ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs: excels on scans, forms, charts, and layout-heavy docs; pure text corpora are usually better served by classic RAG.

## Backend Architecture

- **API server** ‚Äì `backend/main.py` boots `api.app.create_app()` with routers for `meta`, `retrieval`, `indexing`, `maintenance`, and `config`.
- **Vector storage** (`services/qdrant/`)
  - `service.py` ‚Äì orchestrates collection lifecycle and search
  - `collection.py` ‚Äì manages multivector schemas (`original`, `mean_pooling_rows`, `mean_pooling_columns`, optional `muvera_fde`)
  - `search.py` ‚Äì two-stage search (prefetch + rerank)
  - `embedding.py` ‚Äì handles ColPali calls, pooling, and MUVERA
  - `indexing.py` ‚Äì pipelined document indexing with concurrent batches
- **ColPali client** (`services/colpali.py`) ‚Äì talks to the embedding service for images, patches, and queries.
- **MinIO service** (`services/minio.py`) ‚Äì uploads images with auto-sized worker pools and retries.
- **Chat interface** (`frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts`) ‚Äì streams OpenAI responses with page citations.

## Indexing Pipeline

1. **Upload** ‚Äì `POST /index` schedules a background job.
2. **PDF ‚Üí images** ‚Äì `api/utils.py::convert_pdf_paths_to_images` rasterises each page via `pdf2image`.
3. **Batch processing** ‚Äì `DocumentIndexer` in `services/qdrant/indexing.py`
   - Splits pages into batches (`BATCH_SIZE`)
   - Embeds via `ColPaliService` (original + pooled vectors)
   - Stores images in MinIO
   - Upserts vectors into Qdrant
4. **Pipeline mode** ‚Äì When `ENABLE_PIPELINE_INDEXING=True`, embedding, storage, and upserts overlap using dual thread pools sized from `config.get_pipeline_max_concurrency()`.
5. **Progress** ‚Äì `/progress/stream/{job_id}` streams status updates over SSE.

Collection schemas come from the model dimension reported by `/info`. Images live under `images/<uuid>.<ext>` with public URLs unless configured otherwise. Disabling pipeline mode processes one batch at a time for easier debugging.

---

## Retrieval Pipeline

1. **Query embedding** ‚Äì `EmbeddingProcessor.batch_embed_query` calls `/embed/queries`.
2. **Two-stage search** ‚Äì `SearchManager._reranking_search_batch`
   - Optional MUVERA first-stage when enabled
   - Prefetch against pooled vectors when `QDRANT_MEAN_POOLING_ENABLED=True`
   - Final rerank with original vectors (`with_payload=True`)
3. **Response assembly** ‚Äì `SearchManager.search_with_metadata` returns metadata and image URLs; `/search` formats the API response.
4. **Multimodal answer** ‚Äì The frontend chat route streams OpenAI responses and emits `kb.images` events for the UI gallery.

## Multivector Design

- Patch-aware scoring uses `MAX_SIM` across tokens to mirror ColPali search behaviour.
- Row/column pooling preserves coarse layout information and often improves recall on complex pages.
- MUVERA (when enabled) adds a single-vector projection to accelerate the first selection stage before reranking with multivectors.

## Vision RAG vs. Text RAG

| Aspect | Snappy (Vision) | Traditional Text RAG |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Modality** | Works on page images; no OCR required. Handles scans, handwriting, diagrams. | Requires text extraction; struggles on low-quality scans or heavy layout. |
| **Representation** | Multivectors per page (patch tokens + pooled variants + optional MUVERA FDE). | Single vector per text chunk, often with overlapping windows. |
| **Indexing cost** | Higher: rasterisation, image embeddings, object storage. | Lower: text extraction and embeddings only. |
| **Retrieval quality** | Strong on layout awareness and visual context. | Strong on semantic text understanding when OCR is clean. |
| **Latency** | Multivector search + multimodal prompts cost more. | Typically faster lookups and lighter prompts. |
| **Context delivery** | Sends images to multimodal LLM for grounded answers. | Sends text chunks; grounding depends on OCR fidelity. |
| **Failure modes** | Missing fine text, higher prompt costs. | OCR errors, chunk boundary issues, loss of layout. |
| **Best for** | Scanned PDFs, forms, tables, diagrams, handwritten notes. | Plain text corpora, code, documents with reliable OCR. |

## Possible Enhancements

- Hybrid vision/text pipeline combining OCR when it helps.
- Cross-encoder or LLM-based reranking for even tighter precision.
- Region-of-interest citations (bounding boxes and highlights).
- Signed URLs and authentication for production deployments.
- Telemetry, evaluation harnesses, and richer observability.
- Fine-tuned HNSW parameters and quantisation layouts for large collections.

---

## Implementation Pointers

- Indexing paths: `api/utils.py::convert_pdf_paths_to_images`, `DocumentIndexer.index_documents` in `services/qdrant/indexing.py`.
- Collection schema management: `CollectionManager.create_collection_if_not_exists` in `services/qdrant/collection.py`.
- Pooling logic: `EmbeddingProcessor._pool_image_tokens` in `services/qdrant/embedding.py`.
- Two-stage query: `SearchManager._reranking_search_batch` in `services/qdrant/search.py`.
- MinIO URLs: `MinioService._get_image_url()` and `_extract_object_name_from_url()`.
- Chat streaming: `frontend/app/api/chat/route.ts` (SSE) and `frontend/lib/api/chat.ts`.

## Notes from the Code

- The ColPali API is expected to return embeddings with token boundaries; `ColPaliService.embed_images` already matches that contract.
- The frontend controls the OpenAI model via `OPENAI_MODEL` (`frontend/.env.local`). The backend stays focused on retrieval and system duties.
