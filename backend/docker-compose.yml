# Backend Standalone - Development/Testing
# Run backend with minimal dependencies for development
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up       - Start backend with Qdrant
#   docker compose logs -f  - View logs
#   docker compose down     - Stop services
#
# Note: ColPali and DeepSeek OCR are disabled by default.
# Enable them in .env if needed for testing.
