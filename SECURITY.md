## Security Best Practices

### For Deployment

#### Environment Variables

**Never commit sensitive credentials to version control:**

```bash
# ✅ Good - Use environment files (gitignored)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=securepassword123

# ❌ Bad - Hardcoded credentials
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-1234567890"  # In committed code
```

**Use strong, unique passwords:**
- MinIO: At least 16 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
- Qdrant: Use API keys in production
- OpenAI: Rotate keys periodically

#### CORS Configuration

**Set explicit allowed origins:**

```bash
# ❌ Development only - Too permissive
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=*

# ✅ Production - Explicit domains
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
```

#### HTTPS/TLS

**Always use HTTPS in production:**
- Use SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt, CloudFlare, etc.)
- Set `MINIO_USE_SSL=true`
- Configure Next.js behind a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik)
- Enable HSTS headers

#### File Uploads

**Validate and sanitize uploads:**
- Enforce file type restrictions (PDF only by default)
- Set maximum file sizes (`UPLOAD_MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- Limit concurrent uploads (`UPLOAD_MAX_FILES`)
- Scan uploaded files for malware (recommended in production)

#### API Rate Limiting

**Implement rate limiting for production:**

```python
# backend/api/app.py
from slowapi import Limiter
from slowapi.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(key_func=get_remote_address)
app.state.limiter = limiter

# Apply to expensive endpoints
@app.get("/search")
@limiter.limit("60/minute")
async def search_documents(...):
    ...
```

### For Development

#### Dependency Management

**Keep dependencies updated:**

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
uv pip list --outdated
uv pip install -U package-name

# Frontend
cd frontend
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

**Audit for vulnerabilities:**

```bash
# Backend
pip-audit  # Install: pip install pip-audit

# Frontend
yarn audit
yarn audit fix
```

#### Secrets Management

**Use `.env` files (never commit them):**

```bash
# .env.example - Commit this
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=your_minio_password

# .env - Gitignored, contains real secrets
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-actual-key-123
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=MyS3cur3P@ssw0rd!
```

**Rotate secrets regularly:**
- OpenAI API keys: Every 90 days
- MinIO credentials: Every 180 days
- Database passwords: Every 180 days

#### Code Security

**Input Validation:**

```python
# ✅ Good - Pydantic validation
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, validator

class SearchRequest(BaseModel):
    query: str = Field(..., max_length=500)
    k: int = Field(default=10, ge=1, le=100)
    
    @validator('query')
    def sanitize_query(cls, v):
        # Remove potentially dangerous characters
        return v.strip()
```

**SQL Injection Prevention:**
- Use parameterized queries (SQLAlchemy, asyncpg)
- Never interpolate user input into SQL strings
- Qdrant uses its own query language (safe by design)

**XSS Prevention:**
- React escapes output by default (safe)
- Sanitize HTML if using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`
- Use CSP headers in production

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Architecture

#### 1. API Key Exposure (Frontend)

**Issue:**  
The frontend chat route requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` in the Next.js environment. This is intentional for edge runtime but means the key is exposed server-side.

**Mitigation:**
- Key is in `.env.local` (server-side only, not exposed to browser)
- Use API key restrictions (OpenAI dashboard)
- Consider backend proxy for production deployments

**Production Recommendation:**
```typescript
// Option 1: Backend proxy (recommended)
// Move chat logic to backend/api/routers/chat.py

// Option 2: API key per user
// Implement user authentication and per-user API keys
```

#### 2. MinIO Public Access

**Issue:**  
Page images are served from MinIO with public read access for simplicity.

**Mitigation:**
- Images are stored in dedicated bucket
- No sensitive metadata in image URLs
- Pre-signed URLs can be implemented if needed

**Enhanced Security:**
```python
# backend/services/minio.py
def get_presigned_url(self, object_name: str, expires: int = 3600):
    """Generate temporary signed URL for private access."""
    return self.client.presigned_get_object(
        bucket_name=self.bucket_name,
        object_name=object_name,
        expires=timedelta(seconds=expires)
    )
```

#### 3. No Authentication/Authorization

**Issue:**  
The application currently has no user authentication or role-based access control.

**Impact:**
- Anyone with network access can use the API
- Suitable for internal deployments, demos, or behind VPN
- Not suitable for public internet without additional security

**Production Recommendation:**
- Implement authentication (JWT, OAuth, API keys)
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use a reverse proxy with authentication (OAuth2 Proxy, Authelia)
- Consider managed solutions (Auth0, Clerk, NextAuth.js)

#### 4. Docker Security

**Issue:**  
Default Docker Compose setup may run containers as root.

**Mitigation:**
- Use non-root users in production Dockerfiles
- Apply security contexts in docker-compose.yml
- Use Docker secrets for sensitive data

**Enhanced docker-compose.yml:**
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - NET_BIND_SERVICE
    user: "1000:1000"
```
