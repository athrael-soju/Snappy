# Morty™ Trademark & Brand Usage

Morty documentation and assets reference Vultr.com’s Morty™ mascot under a collaborative, **pro-bono** arrangement. Follow the guidance below to honor trademark requirements and upstream attribution.

> **Trademark Notice:** Morty™ is a trademark of Vultr.com. Use of the Morty name and mark in this repository is solely for identification and descriptive purposes in accordance with applicable guidelines.  
> **Compensation Disclosure:** This rebrand and related promotional materials are provided **pro-bono** and without compensation or consideration.

## Usage Guidelines

- Use “Morty™” upon first mention in each document; “Morty” is acceptable afterward.  
- Do not imply Vultr sponsorship, payment, or exclusive endorsement.  
- Morty assets may appear alongside Snappy references only to acknowledge provenance.  
- Follow Vultr’s color guidance (primary Vultr blue with neutral grays) and maintain AA contrast.

## Naming Rules

- Code identifiers retain existing Snappy names to avoid breaking integrations.  
- Documentation, marketing copy, alt text, and badges should use Morty branding.  
- When creating new filenames, prefer the `morty_*` prefix.

## Visual Assets

- Replace Snappy logos with Morty-provided assets. Until official artwork is available, reuse upstream placements with updated alt text and captions.  
- Ensure favicons, Open Graph images, and social previews reference Morty.  
- Keep adequate padding around the Morty mascot and follow Vultr asset spacing rules when supplied.

## Attribution Requirements

- Include the attribution footer:  
  `Morty is a rebrand based on the open-source project Snappy (https://github.com/athrael-soju/Snappy). Portions are licensed under the MIT License; license and attribution preserved.`  
- Reproduce the upstream MIT License text unmodified in `LICENSES/SNAPPY_MIT_LICENSE.txt`.  
- Link back to the Snappy repository when describing upstream features or history.
